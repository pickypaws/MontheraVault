Monthera Vault Overview

Monthera Vault is a non-custodial staking protocol deployed on the Monad Testnet. It is designed to distribute the native token $MTHR through a transparent, on-chain reward mechanism based on the ERC4626 vault standard. The core idea is to enable users to earn uncirculated $MTHR tokens by staking the same token via a controlled, fixed-reward system.


Token Distribution and Supply Allocation

The total supply of $MTHR is pre-minted and distributed with the following allocation:

85% of the total supply is allocated directly to the reward pool inside the vault.

10% is allocated for liquidity provisioning on decentralized exchanges (DEXes), of which 3% is currently deployed and 7% is held in reserve for future liquidity support.

4% is allocated to the core development team to support the ongoing development of the ecosystem.

2% is used as an initial staking seed to bootstrap the vault and encourage early participation.

1% is distributed freely through a public claim feature available to all wallet addresses.

No additional minting of $MTHR will occur after the initial deployment, ensuring a fixed total supply. Only staking through Monthera Vault enables users to unlock the 85% of $MTHR that is locked in the reward pool.


Staking and Reward Mechanism

To participate in staking, users must first acquire $MTHR tokens via available liquidity pools on supported DEX platforms. Once they hold $MTHR, they may stake it into Monthera Vault to begin earning rewards.

The vault operates on a fixed reward rate of 1.1902 $MTHR per second, which is distributed proportionally among stakers. The rewards are funded entirely from the 85% pre-minted token supply stored inside the vault.

Vault Token and Transferability

When users deposit $MTHR into the vault, they receive a $sMTHR that represents their share in the vault. Unlike many staking systems, the vault token in Monthera Vault is transferable, meaning:

Users can transfer their $sMTHR to another wallet.

The new wallet holder can directly claim any accumulated rewards associated with that $sMTHR.

$sMTHR ownership implies full rights to claim staking rewards without needing to perform a fresh staking action.


This design adds flexibility for token holders while preserving a clear separation between vault share ownership and reward eligibility.

Key Features

Fully non-custodial and decentralized.

Fixed reward rate based on time, ensuring predictable reward emission.

$sMTHR are transferable and represent staking share ownership.

Staking and claiming are on-chain, secure, and transparent.

The vault automatically pauses reward distribution if the reward pool is empty.

Complies with ERC4626 for vault interactions and ERC20 for the $MTHR token.


Purpose and Vision

Monthera Vault is designed to bootstrap and grow the $MTHR ecosystem by ensuring fair distribution of tokens through on-chain staking. The protocol ensures that the vast majority of token supply (85%) is only accessible via real user participationâ€”encouraging decentralized ownership and aligned incentives.

By combining fixed tokenomics, a transfer-friendly vault system, and permissionless participation, Monthera Vault aims to create a sustainable and fair foundation for $MTHR token circulation.
